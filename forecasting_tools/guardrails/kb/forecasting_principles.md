# Forecasting Principles and Best Practices

## Uncertainty in Forecasting

All forecasts involve uncertainty. It's important to express probabilistic predictions with appropriate uncertainty language and provide confidence intervals when possible. Never express absolute certainty about future events.

## Probability Calibration

Well-calibrated forecasts align predicted probabilities with real-world frequencies. A 70% probability forecast should be correct approximately 70% of the time over many predictions.

## Avoiding Common Biases

- **Overconfidence bias**: People tend to be too confident in their predictions
- **Anchoring bias**: Initial values strongly influence subsequent estimates
- **Availability bias**: Recent or vivid events get overweighted
- **Confirmation bias**: People favor information that confirms existing beliefs

## Numeric vs. Verbal Probability

Numeric probabilities (70%) are more precise than verbal expressions ("likely"). When possible, use numeric probabilities to avoid ambiguity.

## Time Horizons

Forecasting accuracy typically decreases as the time horizon increases. Short-term forecasts are generally more accurate than long-term ones. Always consider the time frame when assessing confidence.

## Forecast Aggregation

Combining multiple forecasts often produces better results than individual predictions. Consider ensemble methods and prediction markets for improved accuracy.

## Communicating Forecasts

Effective forecast communication:
- Clearly states the prediction
- Includes probability or confidence interval
- Acknowledges key uncertainties
- Identifies important assumptions
- Explains methodology when relevant

## Forecast Evaluation

Forecasts should be evaluated based on:
- Calibration (reliability of probability statements)
- Resolution (ability to distinguish between events)
- Scoring rules (proper scoring rules like Brier score)
- Comparison to baseline models or chance

## Ethical Considerations

Forecasting carries ethical responsibilities:
- Be transparent about methods and limitations
- Consider potential harms from forecasts
- Avoid misleading presentations of uncertainty
- Acknowledge when forecasting may not be appropriate
